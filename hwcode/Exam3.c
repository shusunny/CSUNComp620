CSUN COMP 620 Fall 2020 Exam-3 Nov. 29, 2020

I (LastName):  Sun    (FirstName): Zhen      pledge by
honor that I will not talk, text, chat and search
the web during this online exam with anybody or via
any device (phone,internet, â€¦.).

The following sequential program solves one-dimensional (a[]) heat distribution problem with n elements based upon finite difference equation:

/*
(80 Pts)a-Convert it to an efficient parallel
algorithm using p processors.
Assume p is even and n (n>>p) is divisible by p.
(10 Pts)b-Compute tcomm and tcomp of your algorithm.
(10 Pts)c-What is the suitable network for your algorithm?

Save your exam in xxxxxE3.c, where xxxxx is at
most the first 5characters of your last name.

To compile : mpicc xxxxxE3.c
To execute : mpiexec -n p a.out n f1 f2 f3
p is number of processors
n is number of inputs, and
f1, f2, f3 are 3 float numbers
Example: mpiexec -n 20 a.out 1000 100.0 50.0 100.0
After compiling and testing your c program, upload this file in canvas Exam-3, before 7:00 p.m.
11/29/20.
NOTES:
NO points will be given to submission with compile error.
In fairness to all, absolutely no file will
be accepted by email.
A file will not be graded if has no name at the
beginning and has compile/execution error.
